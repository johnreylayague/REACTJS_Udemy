The default behavior of an HTML form submission is to reload the page, which is the standard behavior defined by the HTML specification. 
When you have an HTML form and submit it without any specific handling or prevention of the default action, 
the browser's default behavior is to send a request to the server and reload the page with the response received from that request.
